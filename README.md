First few Jinja templates. Calendar with some light features and a python script to run it.

Will add more as I go along.

Current plans to implement include:
Tooltips
Event indicators
Event popups
Event management

Add small indicators (dots or icons) on dates to represent events, tasks, or notes.
When clicking on a date, show a popup or modal to add, edit, or view events for that date.
Allow users to add, edit, and delete events, and display these events on the calendar.
